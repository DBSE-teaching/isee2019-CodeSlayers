Budget Buddy is your go to application to keep your expenditure in check. With this application in your mobile you can,

<ul>
<li>Forget spending hours going through your bank account on where you spent your money </li>
<li>Forget stressing how you did not plan and spent so much in a month </li>
<li>Forget finding it difficult to plan the last week of each month with no money in hand</li>

Budget Buddy makes adding expenses, seeing history of transaction through list and visual views and setting up threshold values for each month easy. When even renowned companies goes into bankruptcy and countries goes into debt crisis, money management is an surely an issue for a common man. Currency used for trading has evolved from barter system to digital money. Now buying of goods and services has become easier and digital marketing lures us to spend. So, tracking the savings and expenditure is an absolute necessity in this modern world. We aim to address at least some part of this issue with our first android application by incorporating easier computing, accessibility of money and tracking of money flow.
