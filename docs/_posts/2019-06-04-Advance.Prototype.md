Hello everyone ! Welcome to our third blog article. We are nearing the end of our journey on providing an application that will help all of you in maintaining your budget. In this article we have explained about the design patterns we could have followed, people who could most benefit with this application, design solutions and few changes from our previous blog. We have also finally given our application a name and logo. Revealing !  

<h1><b>Design Pattern</b></h1>

Design Patterns are the best reusable solutions to many of the repeating problems that arises during software development. It is the best practice followed by many experience developers to create a blueprint of the entire system, class structure and inheritance, object creation and relationship. We being new code warriors, were just introduced with these patterns. While we learnt about these, our design could adapt the design patterns mentioned in the following way.

Three structural patterns could be incorporated into our design if each transaction is created as an object from a class. 

<b> 1. Facade design pattern </b> - User has been given the option to add a new category. Using a facade class to hide the the implementation of all the other fields and the category behaviour, by just having a separate class for category and exposing the particular class alone for the user to manipulate by creating an object everytime an user adds a new category. Mainly to hide the complex implementation and provide a simple interface for user. 

<b> 2. Bridge design pattern </b> - Bridge design pattern for the new transaction class to use the category interface and inturn use the expense/income category objects based on whether the user selects income/expense. Income and expense are seperate classes inherited from the new transaction class. The reason is to seperate the abstraction of the category from the implementation of the transaction class so that it could be used in the above case too. 

<b> 3. Decorator design pattern </b> - Decorator design pattern to add recurrence only when the user selects such. Otherwise only the core fields needed for an transaction would be part of the transaction object. This is dynamically add the extra field whenever needed. 


<h1><b>Coding Conventions</b></h1>
<h1><b>Context of Use</b></h1>

The context of use describes the target user groups of our application. For this, user personas are created which includes the goals and frustrations, demoghraphic details and so on. Illustrated below are two user personas indicating two target user groups.

<h1><b>Design Solution</b></h1>

When we planned the design we wanted the most user friendly interface. We designed the interface considering two things. 

1. Familiar and Intuitive inerface
2. Simple and Quick interface  

We used the following items efficiently to attain our goal. 

<b>1. Navigation bar :</b> Most of the applications available has a navigation bar and users have been familiar with this. This could be used to launch any functionality from anywhere in the application. Less back clicks and also user will have an idea of all the functions available when they just draw the navigation bar. 

<b>2. Tabs and swipe :</b> As seen in the screenshots below tabs that can easily be swiped are used between expense and income. This gives the user easier way to switch between expense and income. Also make both the transactions look similar for the user though the implementation is different. 

<b>3. Fragments :</b> The application is completely designed with one main activity and rest fragments as the transfer of data between fragments is a lot quicker than between transactions. 

The screenshot below covers the epic and user stories related to adding a new transaction. A brief overview of each step is given below each image.

The screenshot below covers the epic and user stories related to seeing history of transactions in both summary tab and history tab. Also given a screenshot where the transaction could be updated/deleted. A brief overview of each step is given below each image.
