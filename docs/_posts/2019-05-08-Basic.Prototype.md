<h1><b>Requirements:</b></h1>

<h2><b>Gathering Requirements</b></h2>

The requirements were gathered during the regular weekly meetings that are held with the customer. The weekly interrogative sessions helped us come up with a finalised set of requirements. The frequent communication among team members through Trello and Whatsapp also made collecting the requirements more efficient. The requirements of the Money control app include, 

1. <b>Homescreen:</b> The homescreen should contain the 5 most recent transactions, the total balance and a button to add expense or income
2. <b>Add new expenses and history:</b> Add expenses should have the following fields Amount(Only number), date, categroy, payment method and notes(optional). Show expenses should a filter to see particular transactions. 
3. <b>Add new income and history: </b>Similar to how expenses works  
4. <b>Visual stats:</b> Based on the categories or split ups, the overall expense as well as expenses per category must be illustrated with a pie chart
5. <b>Settings:</b> A settings button is required in order to either add or alter a category based on user requirement and also to change pin if pin option is activated 

<h2><b>Analysing Requirements </b></h2>
Our team iteratively updated the requirements based on three categories

1. Basic Requirements

2. Essential Requirements

3. Nice-to-have Requirements.

With these classifications and communication among team members, the requirements were easily structured.

<h2><b>Mapping requirements to user stories</b></h2>

Requirement specification was carried out by adhering to the specifications given by the customer and the classifications created by us. With the customer requirements and effective ordering of these requirements in the respective classification, we as a team were able to come up with a design of the entire app.

We divided the <b>basic requirements</b> into five main <b>epics</b>. Each epic would handle one basic requirement. From there we started distributing each <b>essential requirement</b> into corresponding epics as individual <b>user stories</b>. Since we already had the layout of the application in mind, we were able to formulate  structured user stories covering all the requirements. 

Use case diagram was created based on the functionality of the entire app and thereby establishing the relationship between the user(actor) and the respective tasks to be performed for using the app.

<h2><b>Wrong Assumptions</b></h2>

* We mistook user stories and sprint planning to be the same. Upon clarification, we understood the differences.

* We thought that the app was a multi-user app. But later, during the meeting with the customer we understood that the app is a single-user app

* We thought of authenticating the user through PIN/Pattern system but we are planning to add it as part of settings tab.
Totally upto the user's preference.

* Exit option is not required for these kind of apps so had to remove it.

* Only Show expense was initially planned for display, but a summary of total balance and expense has to be displayed in a gist in "Summary" tab.

<h1><b>User Stories</b></h1>

Use <b>Case diagrams </b> draw a relationship between the user and the tasks he has to perform. So in short, a use case diagram describes a particular functionality of the Android application.

The above use case diagram summarizes the overall  functionality of the app. The actor, in this case the user first views the homescreen which has the following options:
1. Create a new entry

2. View the recent stats.

The creation of the financial entry involves adding an expense or income based on the specific category. The expense or income is entered with respect to the specified date and time.
The stats are the viewed from the database where the 5 most recent transactions and the total balance are stored.
