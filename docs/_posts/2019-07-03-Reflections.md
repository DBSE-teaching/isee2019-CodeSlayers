Your budget buddy welcomes you to read our fifth about the course, team work and the challenges we faced. 

<h2>TECHNICAL CHALLENGES </h2>
<ul>
<li>We had little experience in software development and found it difficult to grasp the concept quickly. Because of this we 
had difficulty in implementing such concepts in our software like Design patterns and Coding conventions for example. </li>
<li>We also had difficulty in understanding the concepts required for android development and had to work our though the 
project to implement our thoughts, ideas and requirements to put a up fully useful application. 
</li>
<li>Testing the application was challenging as we had no testing experiece in testing of an entire software and also the 
concepts of White and Black box testing was very new to us.</li>
</ul>

<h2>TEAM WORK </h2>
<p> Being a four member team and having several different kind of activites from blog and presentation to development and 
testing good team work plays the major role. </p>

<p>Data values used in these above use cases adhere to either Equivalence classes or boundary value analysis.</p>



<h4>Benefits</h4>

<ul>
<li>Sharing knowledge as each member had their strengths it helped in sharing each member's knowledge</li>
<li>Outside box thinking, we did not get struck anywhere as team would jump in and provide their thoughts</li>
<li>Quick completion of work and doubts can easily be asked and cleared through the team members.</li>
<li>Various brain storming sessions has helped us to build the requirement, design and development. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Challenges</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Communication, though we had direct meeting and whats app groups sometimes there was misunderstanding of information. </li>
<li>Maintaining the latest code in the repository was difficult as each of us were working on different parts of the 
applicaiton. </li>
<li>Sometimes there was issues when coming to a final decision as there was no concrete team lead role defined. </li>
</ul>

<h2>ABOUT THE COURSE</h2>
The course was very helpful in introducing various concepts in software engineering. It met our expectations in the 
following way,  

<h4>How it met our expectations ?</h4>

<ul>
<li>Learn the software development knowledge like class diagrams, design patterns and princlple, use case and user stories through in interesting way like android development was very helpful. </li>

<li>This very much improved our coding knowledge, experience and standards. </li>

<li>Also learnt to develop a complete android application which is a new skill added to our skillset. </li>

</ul>

<h4>Challenge</h4>

<li>
The only thing that could have been more helpful was to give the blog questions and slides available at the start of the course. So that it would have helped in implementing the principles thought such as design pattern and design coding conventions as we came to know of such concepts only after we had completed the development. </li>
