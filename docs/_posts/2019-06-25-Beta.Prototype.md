Your budget buddy welcomes you to read our fourth and last blog of this month. In this blog we would be explaining about the software testing methods we chose and how we implemented it.

<p>A software's success or failure is evaluated based on it's ability to deliver the requirements, fulfilling the user's expectation and running without faults. There are multiple software testing techniques to measure and determine the software quality.</p>

<h2>TESTING PHASES</h2>
<ul>
<li>Unit Testing</li>
<li>Integration Testing</li>
<li>System Testing</li>
<li>Acceptance Testing</li>
</ul>

<p>Software quality and assurance is verified and validated using Static & dynamic testing methods. We used Black Box and White box testing methods to implement the testing phases.</p>


<h2>BLACK BOX TESTING </h2>
<p> Black box testing uses a specification-oriented test design and it should not involve the internal logic. The tested cases are framed with a set of characteristics. These characteristics can define on how a system works and how/when to stop the testing. So using these test cases derived from use cases scenarios. </p>

<p>We will describe few use case scenarios to define how we used black box testing in our Software Development Life Cycle. Below are the five uses cases which were tested by users</p>

<h2>WHITE BOX TESTING</h2>

White-Box Testing is a type of testing which involves test case design by knowing the internal logic.

The following classes were tested using White-Box Testing:

<h2>1.LoginActivity: Validate user credentials</h2>
Following code is the main method in the authorization class where it checks the user entered PIN is correct or not to launch the application. The code which starts executing once the user clicks the submit button is highlighted and line 59-69 are button click listerner, getting value from database and check whether data is there in the database. The main condition is at line 70 which is explained below.

<h4> Cases: </h4> 

<h4> Incorrect PIN </h4> 
When incorrect PIN is entered the condition at line 70 fails and jumps to line 73 executing where it prompts the user to enter correct PIN 

<h4> Correct PIN </h4> 
When a correct PIN is entered the condition at line 70 passes and the application activities are launched

<h3>2.Add new category </h3>

Following code is the method in the Settings class which checks and adds the new category entered by the user into the database.  

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48119755933_8f1053a7dd_o_d.png" alt="1" align="center" >

<h4> Cases: </h4>

<h4>No category information Given </h4>
Condition at 67 fails and jumps to line 76 where it prompts the user to enter the correct category

<h4>Category data provided - Inserted successfully </h4>
Condition at 67 passes and tries to insert the data at line 68. Checks the condition whether data is inserted successfully at line 69 and passes to display category inserted 

<h4>Category data provided - Not inserted successfully </h4>
Condition at 67 fails and tries to insert the data at line 68. Checks the condition whether data is inserted successfully at line 69 and 
fails. Jumps to line 73-74

<h3>3.Add email</h3>

Following code is the main method to add email for sending the monthly report in the report fragment class which checks and adds the email id entered by the user into the database.  

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48119755903_06992c48d2_o_d.png" alt="1" align="center">

<h4>Cases: </h4>

<h4>Email id - correct format </h4>
Check whether the id entered is in the correct format and passes this condition at line 162. Line 163-165 gets executed where email is entered is added to the databases and displays the same 

<h4>Email id- Wrong format </h4>
When the email is entered is not in the correct format this condition at line 162 fails and lines 167-168 executes which prompts the user to enter the email id in correct format.

<h3>4.Threshold Change </h3>

Following code is the main method in threshold fragment to add threshold values for each category.   

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48120035963_9d6a9de225_o_d.jpg" alt="1" align="center">

<h4>Cases: </h4>

<h4>Threshold not entered properly </h4>
Threshold value entered doesn't have numbers alone and the condition at line 51 fails and moves to line 62 which prompts the user to enter the correct value 

<h4>Threshold entered properly and inserted successfully </h4>
Threshold value entered is in correct format and line 52-58 gets executed to insert the threshold value in the database. 

<h4>Threshold not interested </h4>
Threshold value if not inserted in the database then line 59-60 gets executed

<h3>5.Visualize pie chart</h3>
Following code is the main method in Visualisation fragment class to set up the pie chart.

<h4>Cases: </h4>

<h4>Chart created successfully</h4>
Category and expense values gets added in loop at line 143-145. Line 146-149 to add the data and 152-155 to set up the chart.

<h2>SUMMARY OF CHANGES</h2>

The following new changes have been added compared to the advance prototype in this Beta Prototype. 

<h3>NEW FEATURES</h3> 

The following new REQUIREMENTS were requested by the customer which we added into our user stories and completed

<h4>Exporting monthly data</h4> 

Export monlthy income and expense report to the email id provided by the user. 

<h4>Threshold values</h4> 

User can set threshold value for each category now and a comparison between threshold and monthly expense is provided as a chart. Also notification is provided when the threshold increases while adding a new expense. 

<h3>CHANGES IN EXISTING FEATURES</h3> 

The following changes in existing features were requested by the customer.

<h4>New visual representation</h4>

In addition to pie charts representing category data, bar charts has been added representing yearly expenses based on monthly and category data. 

<h4>Forget pin </h4>

An option has been added for the user to set an email id and send the pin the mail when the user forgets.
