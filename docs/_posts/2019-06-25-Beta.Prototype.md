Your buddget buddy welcomes you to read our fourth and last blog of this month. In this blog we would be explaning about the software testing methods we chose and how we implemented it.

<p>A software's success or failure is evaluated based on it's ability to deliver the requirements, fulfilling the user's expectation and running without faults. There are multiple software testing techniques to measure and determine the software quality.</p>

<h1>Test Phases</h1>
<ul>
<li>Unit Testing</li>
<li>Integration Testing</li>
<li>System Testing</li>
<li>Acceptance Testing</li>
</ul>

<p>Software quality and assurance is be verified and validated using Static & dynamic testing methods. We used Black Box and White box testing methods to implement the testing phases.</p>
