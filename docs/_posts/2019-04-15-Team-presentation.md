Mobile phones have become compulsory part of our lives. Mobile applications makes day to day life easier, faster and efficient. Such applications are created by hidden warriors with only fingers as weopons. But they make so many lives better. We are a team of four such warriors and we call ourselves CodeSlayers. 

We are an energetic team who concentrating mainly on android development. We have started our first project which is described below. Continue reading the blog to travel with us in this code war. 

<h1><i>Money control application</i></h1>

Trading of goods and services have always been a significant factor in human civilisation. Currency used for trading has evolved from barter system to digital money. Now buying of goods and services has become easier and digital marketing lures us to spend. So, tracking the savings and expenditure is an absolute necessity in this modern world. An android application for mobiles phones would provide an easier computing, accessibility of money and tracking of money flow. As a regular user of an android phone, apps are an integral part of day-to-day life. The management of the money spent on a daily basis is necessary to keep track of the overall expenditure especially for students. Therefore, for faster and efficient organization of funds, a money control application would be the best solution.

 and expenditure is an absolute necessity in this modern world. An android

I have taken this course to gain knowledge on the cycle of software development. Though having three years experience in IT I believe this course will help me strenghen my basics and understand every nook and corner in software development. Also learning through hands-on knowledge in android development would be good addition to my skillset and sharpen my coding experience. 

<b><i>Prathap Dhanasekaran</i></b>


  Being a student money control is very essential to spend on valuable
 things and also have a track of it for perfect planning. Personally I am
 little absent minded and might loose the track of money flow when time
 passes . This app will help me to utilize my funds in most efficient and
 accurate manner
 
 



<h1><i>Complimentary skills</i></h1>

Each codeslayer have their own strengths. As a team codeslayers complement each other and form the core strength need to drive a project successfully.

<h1><i>Roles and responsibilities</i></h1>

CodeSlayers is a team which doesn't divide and work individually. Each one of us would contribute to all the parts and phases of the project. But we divide ourselves into four teams and have a leader for each team although each member is present in each of the teams. This is just to have point of contact and assign responsibility to one department so that work gets completed.

<h1><i>Communication</i></h1>
In addition to the weekly meeting with the customer, blog and status report, we are planning to use three modes for successfull communication. 

<b> Trello </b> 
We are using Trello for task management. So that everybody would be on the same page about what is worked on and also the progress. 

<b> Direct meeting </b> 
Before customer meeting Codeslayers would also meet every week to brainstorm new ideas,  discuss about the progress and resolve issues internally. Also to share knowledge and help with each other's work.   

<b> Whatsapp </b> 
being an androind application development team and trying to make day to day life easier what's better way than using the most used application. We have a group created in whatapp for informal communication and queries to be cleared by peers quickly and comfortably.

<h1><i>Methodology and flexibility</i></h1>

Since we use agile methodology, we have to be really flexible as one of the main motive of agile methodology is to react to changes in circumstances. We are a team which mainly concentrates on customer satisfaction. If customer needs the requirement to be changed or new requirements to be added, we will meet the requirements and make sure the custormer is satisfied. Also any changes in the team will not affect the product. All these we plan to achieve with a bet team spirit and many brainstorming sessions.
