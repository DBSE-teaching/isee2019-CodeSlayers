<h1><i>Money control application</i></h1>

Trading of goods and services have always been a significant factor in human civilisation. Currency used for trading has evolved from barter system to digital money. Now buying of goods and services has become easier and digital marketing lures us to spend. So, tracking the savings and expenditure is an absolute necessity in this modern world. An android application for mobiles phones would provide an easier computing, accessibility of money and tracking of money flow.

To gain knowledge on the cycle of software development and acquire
hands-on knowledge in android development. Also to sharpen my coding
 skill and improve communication and team work skills

  Being a student money control is very essential to spend on valuable
 things and also have a track of it for perfect planning. Personally I am
 little absent minded and might loose the track of money flow when time
 passes . This app will help me to utilize my funds in most efficient and
 accurate manner
